# Rook
Scrapers for common Berkeley queries

Instructions:  
Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Dictation -> Dictation Commands -> `+`.  
Type your desired trigger phrase for a particular location (i.e., "what time is the stadium gym open today?") and for "Perform:" select Run workflow -> Other -> Path to the relevant Apple script in this repo.  
To use Rook, tap the `fn` button twice and hold on the second time. The dictation box should pop up. Say the trigger phrase, and the system will parse the relevant web page and read the answer back to you.
