# Rook
Scrapers for common Berkeley queries

### Instructions:  
1. Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Dictation -> Dictation Commands -> `+`.  
2. Type your desired trigger phrase for a particular location (i.e., "what time is the stadium gym open today?")
3. For "Perform:" select Run workflow -> Other -> Path to the relevant Apple script in this repo.

### Usage
To use Rook, tap the `fn` button twice and hold on the second time. The dictation box should pop up. Say the trigger phrase, and the system will parse the relevant web page and read the answer back to you.

Currently Rook supports:

1. Stadium gym hours
2. RSF hours
3. Anthropology library hours
4. VLSB library hours
5. Main stacks library hours
6. Moffitt library hours
7. Haas library hours
8. Kresge library hours
9. Chemistry library hours
10. East Asian library hours
11. Art history library hours
12. Doe library hours

I will likely expand functionality to other commonly queried locations.
